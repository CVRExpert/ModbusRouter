# ModbusRouter
# Description:
# This application can solve the problem when it is necessary to receive data from several MODBUS SLAVES, which are located behind an IP address and often have the same MODBUS ADDRESS.
# To do this, you can specify different MODBUS ADDRESS with this device on MODBUS MASTER. 
# In the application settings, it is indicated which serial port is located behind which device, what is its external address and what is the real one.
# During operation, Modbus addresses will be replaced when receiving and transmitting data.
